## Conferences
**SIAM Conference on Mathematics of Data Science** - *Atlanta, GA*

Title: [Protecting Data Privacy in Social Network Studies Using Synthetic Data](https://hjhernandez.shinyapps.io/siam2024/)

Developed synthetic data methodologies for social network studies to preserve confidentiality, employing various methodologies, including approximating the joint probability distribution as a series of conditional distributions, GAN modeling approaches, and a combination of Bayesian networks with variational autoencoders.

**¡Viva La Salud! 3rd Annual College of Health Sciences’ Health Disparities Conference** - *The University of Texas at El Paso*

Title: [Capacity-building assistance for communicable disease surveillance](https://hjhernandez.shinyapps.io/VivaLaSaludApp/)

Developed an end-to-end data pipeline for the City of El Paso Department of Public Health to improve influenza surveillance by addressing data quality issues, resulting in a public-facing dashboard.

## Competition
**UTEP Visualization & Interactive Collaboration Competition**

*Team: Connected Nodes*

Title: [Visualizing Network Graph Comparisons](https://hjhernandez.shinyapps.io/DataVis/)

Developed an R Shiny app that depicts a series of network graphs showcasing the changes that occurred before and after a two-year research training program. In particular, the network models depict latent structures of identity, self-efficacy, and self-concepts for students undergoing biomedical research training.
